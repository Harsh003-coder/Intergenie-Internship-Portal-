AI Powered Internship Recommendation System
<p align="center">










</p>
🌟 Overview

Interngenie is an AI-powered internship recommendation platform that helps students discover the most relevant internship opportunities based on their skills, experience, and interests.

Traditional internship portals rely on keyword matching, which often fails to capture the true meaning of skills and job descriptions. This leads to missed opportunities for students and irrelevant applications for companies.

Interngenie solves this problem using AI embeddings and vector similarity search to understand the semantic meaning of skills and match students with internships that best fit their profile.

Example:

Student Skills

🐍 Python
🤖 Machine Learning
📊 Data Analysis

Recommended Internships

🧠 AI Engineer Intern
📈 Data Science Intern
🔬 ML Research Intern

Even if the keywords differ, the system understands the relationship between skills.

✨ Features

🔍 Semantic Skill Matching
Understands meaning of skills instead of simple keyword matching.

🤖 AI Powered Recommendations
Uses embeddings to recommend relevant internships.

📄 Resume Based Matching
Upload a resume and get personalized internship suggestions.

⚡ Fast Vector Search
Vector databases allow fast similarity search across thousands of internships.

📊 Smart Ranking System
Internships ranked based on similarity scores.
